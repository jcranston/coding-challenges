# Positive AI Outcomes Context

## Example of a Positive Outcome
- When the user requests a new grokking challenge, the AI should:
  - Select a high-value, likely interview problem from any category
  - Generate the canonical directory and README (with examples)
  - Stub out user and canonical solutions with descriptive names and docstrings
  - Write parameterized tests (with helpers as needed)
  - Add an entry to tags.md
  - Generate a detailed EXPLANATION.md
  - Place the problem in the correct canonical directory
  - Do all of the above automatically, without prompting for confirmation, and following all project conventions
- **Reference:** The Linked List Cycle (LeetCode 141) challenge was generated exactly as requested and is a model for future positive outcomes.
