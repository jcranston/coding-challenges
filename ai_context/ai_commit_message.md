# Commit Message Style Context

## Preferred Commit Message Style
- Use concise commit messages of 1-2 sentences maximum.
- The commit message must capture all changes reflected in `git status`, not just the most recent or visible change.
- Summarize the full scope of the commit in a clear, brief statement.
- Example: "Add rigorous TSP proof and enhance AI context with debugging methodology"
- Avoid long, detailed, multi-line commit messages unless specifically requested.
- The message should capture the essence of the changes (e.g., new problems, explanations, tags, automation, etc.).
- Use this concise style for all future commits unless the user requests otherwise.
