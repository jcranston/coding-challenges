# Commit Message Style Context

## Preferred Commit Message Style
- Use a single, concise sentence that summarizes the main types of changes in the commit.
- The commit message must capture all changes reflected in `git status`, not just the most recent or visible change. Summarize the full scope of the commit.
- Example: "Add new challenges, explanations, tests, tags, and AI context updates"
- Avoid long, detailed, multi-line commit messages unless specifically requested.
- The message should still capture the essence of the changes (e.g., new problems, explanations, tags, automation, etc.).
- Use this style for all future commits unless the user requests otherwise.
