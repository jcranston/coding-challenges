# Explanation: Longest Subarray with Sum at Most K

## Problem Recap
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`, the task is to find the length of the longest contiguous subarray whose sum is less than or equal to `k`. If there is no such subarray, return 0.

## High-level Approach
The problem is a variant of the classic subarray sum problem, but instead of finding a subarray with an exact sum, we want the longest subarray with sum at most `k`. A brute-force approach would check all subarrays, but this is inefficient for large arrays. Instead, we use prefix sums and a monotonic queue (deque) to efficiently track candidate subarrays.

## Step-by-step Breakdown
1. **Prefix Sums:**
   - Compute prefix sums so that the sum of any subarray `nums[i:j]` is `prefix_sums[j] - prefix_sums[i]`.
2. **Deque for Candidates:**
   - Maintain a deque of indices where the prefix sums are increasing. This helps efficiently find the leftmost index such that the subarray sum is at most `k`.
3. **Main Loop:**
   - For each position `j` in the prefix sums:
     - Remove indices from the front of the deque if the subarray sum exceeds `k`.
     - Update the maximum length if a valid subarray is found.
     - Maintain the monotonicity of the deque by removing indices from the back if their prefix sum is greater than or equal to the current prefix sum.

## Annotated Code
```python
from collections import deque

def longest_subarray_with_sum_at_most_k(nums, k):
    prefix_sums = [0]
    for num in nums:
        prefix_sums.append(prefix_sums[-1] + num)

    q = deque()
    max_len = 0

    for j, curr_sum in enumerate(prefix_sums):
        # Remove indices where the subarray sum would exceed k
        while q and curr_sum - prefix_sums[q[0]] > k:
            q.popleft()
        # Update max_len if a valid subarray is found
        if q:
            max_len = max(max_len, j - q[0])
        # Maintain monotonicity of the deque
        while q and prefix_sums[q[-1]] >= curr_sum:
            q.pop()
        q.append(j)
    return max_len
```
- The deque ensures we always consider the longest possible subarray ending at each position.
- The monotonicity of the deque allows us to efficiently find the best candidate for the left endpoint.

## Test Cases
The following test cases illustrate the main scenarios:
- `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k = 11` → Output: 4 (subarray `[1,2,3,4]`)
- `[2, 1, 5, 1, 3, 2], k = 7` → Output: 3 (subarray `[1,5,1]`)
- `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1], k = 3` → Output: 3 (subarray `[1,1,1]`)

## Common Pitfalls
- Forgetting to use prefix sums, which makes subarray sum calculation inefficient.
- Not maintaining the monotonicity of the deque, which can lead to incorrect results or inefficiency.
- Not handling negative numbers correctly (the algorithm works for negative numbers as well).

## Variations
- If the problem asked for the shortest subarray with sum at least `k`, a different approach (often sliding window or binary search) would be needed.
- If all numbers are positive, a simpler sliding window suffices.
