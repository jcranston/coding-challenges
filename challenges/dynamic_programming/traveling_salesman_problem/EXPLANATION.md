# Traveling Salesman Problem - Detailed Explanation

## Problem Recap

The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is one of the most famous and challenging optimization problems in computer science. Given a set of cities and the distances between each pair, we need to find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the starting city.

This implementation supports **asymmetric distances**, meaning the cost from city A to city B may differ from the cost from city B to city A. This makes the problem more realistic and challenging, as it models real-world scenarios like one-way roads, flight costs, or time-dependent travel.

This problem is NP-hard, meaning there's no known polynomial-time algorithm that can solve all instances optimally. However, for small instances (typically n ≤ 12), we can use dynamic programming to find the exact optimal solution.

## Mathematical Formulation

### Problem Definition

Given a complete directed graph $G = (V, E)$ with $n$ vertices (cities) and edge weights (distances), find a Hamiltonian cycle of minimum total weight.

**Formal Definition:**
- Let $V = \{0, 1, 2, \ldots, n-1\}$ be the set of cities
- Let $d(i,j)$ be the distance from city $i$ to city $j$
- Find a permutation $\pi = (\pi_0, \pi_1, \ldots, \pi_{n-1})$ of cities such that:
  - $\pi_0 = 0$ (start and end at city 0)
  - Each city appears exactly once in the tour
  - The total cost is minimized: $\min \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} d(\pi_i, \pi_{i+1})$ where $\pi_n = \pi_0$

### Asymmetric TSP (ATSP) vs Symmetric TSP (STSP)

**Symmetric TSP:**
- $d(i,j) = d(j,i)$ for all $i, j \in V$
- Can be represented as an undirected graph
- Allows some optimizations (e.g., fixing starting city)

**Asymmetric TSP:**
- $d(i,j) \neq d(j,i)$ for some $i, j \in V$
- Must be represented as a directed graph
- More complex, requires full DP approach

### Complexity Analysis

**Time Complexity:**
- **Brute Force**: $O((n-1)!)$ - try all possible tours
- **Dynamic Programming**: $O(n^2 \times 2^n)$ - for each of $2^n$ states, try $n$ positions
- **Space Complexity**: $O(n \times 2^n)$ - DP table size

**Why $O(n^2 \times 2^n)$?**
- $2^n$ possible subsets of cities (bitmask representation)
- For each subset, $n$ possible ending cities
- For each state, try up to $n$ previous cities

## High-Level Approach

The key insight is to use **dynamic programming with bit manipulation** to represent the state of partial tours. We'll use a bottom-up DP approach where:

- `dp[mask][pos]` represents the minimum cost to visit all cities in the bitmask `mask`, ending at position `pos`
- `mask` is a binary number where the i-th bit is 1 if city i has been visited
- We build up solutions from smaller subproblems to the complete tour

### Mathematical State Representation

**State Definition:**
- Let $S \subseteq V$ be a subset of visited cities
- Let $i \in S$ be the current city
- Let $\texttt{dp}[S][i]$ be the minimum cost to visit all cities in $S$ ending at city $i$

**Bitmask Encoding:**
- Represent subset $S$ as a binary number: $\texttt{mask} = \sum_{j \in S} 2^j$
- Example: $S = \{0, 2, 3\}$ → $\texttt{mask} = 2^0 + 2^2 + 2^3 = 1 + 4 + 8 = 13$ (binary: 1101)

**State Space:**
- Total states: $2^n \times n$
- For each of $2^n$ possible subsets, track $n$ possible ending cities

## Step-by-Step Algorithm Breakdown

### 1. State Representation
We use a 2D DP table where:
- **First dimension (mask)**: A binary number representing which cities have been visited
- **Second dimension (pos)**: The current city we're at
- **Value**: Minimum cost to reach this state

For example, with 4 cities (0, 1, 2, 3):
- `mask = 5` (binary: 101) means cities 0 and 2 have been visited
- `dp[5][1]` = minimum cost to visit cities 0 and 2, ending at city 1

### 2. Base Case
- `dp[1][0] = 0` (starting at city 0, having visited only city 0)
- All other `dp[1][j] = infinity` for j ≠ 0

### 3. Recurrence Relation

**Mathematical Formulation:**
For each state $(S, i)$, we try all possible previous cities:

$$\texttt{dp}[S][i] = \min_{j \in S \setminus \{i\}} \left( \texttt{dp}[S \setminus \{i\}][j] + d(j,i) \right)$$

**Implementation:**
```python
dp[mask][pos] = min(dp[mask - (1 << pos)][prev] + distances[prev][pos])
```

**Mathematical Breakdown:**
- Let $S$ be the current subset of visited cities
- Let $i$ be the current ending city
- For each $j \in S \setminus \{i\}$ (previous city):
  - $S \setminus \{i\}$ is the subset without city $i$
  - $\texttt{dp}[S \setminus \{i\}][j]$ is the cost to reach subset $S \setminus \{i\}$ ending at $j$
  - $d(j,i)$ is the cost from $j$ to $i$
  - Total cost: $\texttt{dp}[S \setminus \{i\}][j] + d(j,i)$

**Example:**
If $S = \{0,1,2,3\}$ and $i = 2$, we try:
- $j = 0$: $\texttt{dp}[\{0,1,3\}][0] + d(0,2)$
- $j = 1$: $\texttt{dp}[\{0,1,3\}][1] + d(1,2)$  
- $j = 3$: $\texttt{dp}[\{0,1,3\}][3] + d(3,2)$

### 4. Final Answer

**Mathematical Formulation:**
After filling the DP table, the optimal cost is:

$$\min_{i \in V} \left( \texttt{dp}[V][i] + d(i,0) \right)$$

**Implementation:**
```python
min(dp[full_mask][pos] + distances[pos][0])
```

Where:
- $\texttt{full\_mask} = (1 \ll n) - 1 = 2^n - 1$ (all cities visited)
- We try all possible ending cities $i$
- Add the cost $d(i,0)$ to return to starting city

**Mathematical Justification:**
- $\texttt{dp}[V][i]$ is the minimum cost to visit all cities ending at $i$
- $d(i,0)$ is the cost to return to the starting city
- Total cost: $\texttt{dp}[V][i] + d(i,0)$
- Optimal solution: $\min$ over all possible ending cities

**Important Note for Asymmetric TSP**: 
For a complete asymmetric TSP solution, we would need:
$$\min_{i,j \in V} \left( \texttt{dp}[V][i] + d(i,j) \right)$$
for all possible starting cities $j$.

However, for simplicity and to match the problem constraints, we assume the tour starts and ends at city $0$.

## Implementation Details

### Bit Manipulation Tricks
- **Set bit**: `mask | (1 << i)` - mark city i as visited
- **Clear bit**: `mask & ~(1 << i)` - mark city i as unvisited  
- **Check bit**: `mask & (1 << i)` - check if city i is visited
- **Count bits**: `bin(mask).count('1')` - count visited cities

### Space and Time Complexity

**Mathematical Analysis:**
- **Time Complexity**: $O(n^2 \times 2^n)$
  - $2^n$ possible subsets (bitmask states)
  - For each subset, $n$ possible ending cities
  - For each state, try up to $n$ previous cities
  - Total: $2^n \times n \times n = O(n^2 \times 2^n)$

- **Space Complexity**: $O(n \times 2^n)$
  - DP table size: $2^n \times n$
  - Each state stores one integer (cost)

**Detailed Breakdown:**
- **Subset enumeration**: $2^n$ subsets of $n$ cities
- **State transitions**: Each state can be reached from up to $n$ previous states
- **Memory usage**: $2^n \times n \times \texttt{sizeof(int)}$ bytes

### Mathematical Correctness

**Optimal Substructure:**
The optimal solution to TSP has the property that any subpath of the optimal tour is also optimal for the corresponding subproblem.

**Mathematical Proof Sketch:**
- Let $\pi^*$ be the optimal tour
- Let $\pi^*[i:j]$ be a subpath from city $i$ to city $j$
- If $\pi^*[i:j]$ were not optimal for cities $\{i, i+1, \ldots, j\}$, we could replace it with a better subpath, contradicting optimality of $\pi^*$

**Why DP Works:**
- **Overlapping subproblems**: Many tours share common subpaths
- **Optimal substructure**: Optimal solutions contain optimal subsolutions
- **State compression**: Bitmask efficiently represents subsets

## Rigorous Proof of Dynamic Programming Solution

### Theorem: Correctness of TSP Dynamic Programming

**Statement:** The dynamic programming algorithm correctly computes the minimum cost Hamiltonian cycle for the Traveling Salesman Problem.

### Proof Structure

We will prove this in three parts:
1. **Optimal Substructure Property**
2. **Correctness of Recurrence Relation**
3. **Correctness of Final Answer Computation**

### Part 1: Optimal Substructure Property

**Lemma 1:** Let $\pi^* = (v_0, v_1, \ldots, v_{n-1}, v_0)$ be an optimal TSP tour. Then for any subpath $\pi^*[i:j] = (v_i, v_{i+1}, \ldots, v_j)$, this subpath is optimal for visiting the cities $\{v_i, v_{i+1}, \ldots, v_j\}$ starting at $v_i$ and ending at $v_j$.

**Proof:** By contradiction. Suppose $\pi^*[i:j]$ is not optimal. Then there exists a better subpath $\pi'[i:j]$ with cost $c(\pi'[i:j]) < c(\pi^*[i:j])$. 

Construct a new tour $\pi' = (v_0, \ldots, v_{i-1}, \pi'[i:j], v_{j+1}, \ldots, v_{n-1}, v_0)$. Then:
$$c(\pi') = c(\pi^*[0:i-1]) + c(\pi'[i:j]) + c(\pi^*[j+1:n-1]) + d(v_{n-1}, v_0)$$

But $c(\pi'[i:j]) < c(\pi^*[i:j])$, so:
$$c(\pi') < c(\pi^*[0:i-1]) + c(\pi^*[i:j]) + c(\pi^*[j+1:n-1]) + d(v_{n-1}, v_0) = c(\pi^*)$$

This contradicts the optimality of $\pi^*$. Therefore, $\pi^*[i:j]$ must be optimal.

### Part 2: Correctness of Recurrence Relation

**Lemma 2:** The recurrence relation correctly computes the minimum cost to visit subset $S$ ending at city $i$:
$$\texttt{dp}[S][i] = \min_{j \in S \setminus \{i\}} \left( \texttt{dp}[S \setminus \{i\}][j] + d(j,i) \right)$$

**Proof:** We prove by induction on the size of subset $S$.

**Base Case:** $|S| = 1$
- If $S = \{0\}$, then $\texttt{dp}[\{0\}][0] = 0$ (correct)
- If $S = \{i\}$ where $i \neq 0$, then $\texttt{dp}[\{i\}][i] = \infty$ (correct, as we must start at city 0)

**Inductive Step:** Assume the recurrence is correct for all subsets of size $k-1$. Consider subset $S$ of size $k$ and ending city $i$.

Let $\pi^*$ be the optimal path visiting cities in $S$ ending at $i$. Let $j$ be the second-to-last city in $\pi^*$. Then:
- $\pi^*$ consists of optimal path to visit $S \setminus \{i\}$ ending at $j$, followed by edge $(j,i)$
- By inductive hypothesis, $\texttt{dp}[S \setminus \{i\}][j]$ is the minimum cost to visit $S \setminus \{i\}$ ending at $j$
- Therefore, $c(\pi^*) = \texttt{dp}[S \setminus \{i\}][j] + d(j,i)$

Since $\pi^*$ is optimal, $j$ must be chosen to minimize this cost over all possible previous cities in $S \setminus \{i\}$. This is exactly what the recurrence relation computes.

### Part 3: Correctness of Final Answer

**Lemma 3:** The final answer computation correctly finds the minimum cost Hamiltonian cycle:
$$\min_{i \in V} \left( \texttt{dp}[V][i] + d(i,0) \right)$$

**Proof:** Let $\pi^* = (0, v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_{n-1}, 0)$ be the optimal TSP tour.

Then:
- $\texttt{dp}[V][v_{n-1}]$ is the minimum cost to visit all cities ending at $v_{n-1}$
- $d(v_{n-1}, 0)$ is the cost to return to the starting city
- Total cost: $\texttt{dp}[V][v_{n-1}] + d(v_{n-1}, 0)$

Since $\pi^*$ is optimal, $v_{n-1}$ must be chosen to minimize this total cost over all possible ending cities. This is exactly what the final answer computation does.

### Part 4: Completeness of State Space

**Lemma 4:** The algorithm considers all necessary states to find the optimal solution.

**Proof:** 
- **State representation**: Each state $(S, i)$ represents visiting subset $S$ ending at city $i$
- **State transitions**: From state $(S, i)$, we can reach all states $(S \cup \{j\}, j)$ where $j \notin S$
- **Final states**: All states $(V, i)$ where $i \in V$ are considered for the final answer

This covers all possible partial tours and their optimal costs, ensuring no optimal solution is missed.

### Part 5: Time and Space Complexity

**Theorem:** The dynamic programming algorithm has time complexity $O(n^2 \times 2^n)$ and space complexity $O(n \times 2^n)$.

**Proof:**
- **State space**: $2^n$ subsets × $n$ ending cities = $O(n \times 2^n)$ states
- **Transitions per state**: Up to $n$ previous cities to consider
- **Time complexity**: $O(n \times 2^n) \times O(n) = O(n^2 \times 2^n)$
- **Space complexity**: $O(n \times 2^n)$ for the DP table

### Conclusion

The dynamic programming algorithm correctly computes the optimal TSP solution by:
1. **Exploiting optimal substructure** through the recurrence relation
2. **Considering all necessary states** in the state space
3. **Computing the final answer** by minimizing over all possible ending cities

This completes the rigorous proof of correctness for the TSP dynamic programming solution.

## Alternative Approach: Backtracking with Pruning

For smaller instances or when memory is a concern, we can use backtracking:

1. **Start at city 0**
2. **Try all unvisited cities** as the next destination
3. **Use pruning** to skip branches that can't improve the best solution
4. **Track the best solution** found so far

### Pruning Strategies

**Mathematical Lower Bounds:**

1. **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) Lower Bound:**
   - Let $\texttt{MST}(G)$ be the cost of minimum spanning tree
   - Any tour must include all cities, so cost $\geq \texttt{MST}(G)$
   - If current cost + $\texttt{MST}(\texttt{remaining}) > \texttt{bestCost}$, prune

2. **1-Tree Lower Bound:**
   - Remove one vertex, find MST, add back two cheapest edges
   - Provides tighter lower bound than MST

3. **Assignment Problem Lower Bound:**
   - Solve assignment problem (relaxed TSP)
   - Cost of assignment $\leq$ cost of optimal tour

**Mathematical Formulation:**
- Let $L$ be the current partial tour cost
- Let $\texttt{MST}(S)$ be the MST cost for remaining cities $S$
- If $L + \texttt{MST}(S) \geq \texttt{bestCost}$, prune this branch

**Symmetry Breaking:**
- Fix starting city to reduce search space by factor of $n$
- For symmetric TSP: only consider tours starting at city $0$
- For asymmetric TSP: try all starting cities (no symmetry)

## Common Pitfalls and Mistakes

### 1. Forgetting to Return to Start
The tour must return to the starting city. Don't forget to add `distances[pos][0]` to the final cost.

### 2. Incorrect Bit Manipulation
- Using `mask ^ (1 << i)` instead of `mask & ~(1 << i)` for clearing bits
- Not checking if a bit is set before clearing it

### 3. Memory Issues
For n > 12, the DP table becomes too large. Consider:
- Using a sparse representation
- Switching to heuristic methods (greedy, genetic algorithms)
- Using approximation algorithms

### 4. Asymmetric Distance Assumptions
- **Don't assume symmetry**: `distances[i][j]` may not equal `distances[j][i]`
- **Consider directionality**: The optimal tour depends on the direction of travel
- **Check all possibilities**: Asymmetric distances can lead to unexpected optimal tours
- **Don't assume starting city**: In full asymmetric TSP, the optimal tour might not start at city 0

### 5. Symmetry Assumptions
Don't assume the optimal tour is symmetric or follows a simple pattern. The optimal solution can be counterintuitive.

## Test Case Analysis

Let's verify our test cases manually:

### Test Case 1: 4 cities
```
distances = [
    [0, 10, 15, 20],
    [10, 0, 35, 25], 
    [15, 35, 0, 30],
    [20, 25, 30, 0]
]
```

**Manual calculation:**
- Tour 0→1→3→2→0: 10 + 25 + 30 + 15 = 80
- Tour 0→2→3→1→0: 15 + 30 + 25 + 10 = 80
- Tour 0→3→1→2→0: 20 + 25 + 35 + 15 = 95

**Optimal cost: 80**

### Test Case 2: 4 cities
```
distances = [
    [0, 20, 42, 35],
    [20, 0, 30, 34],
    [42, 30, 0, 12],
    [35, 34, 12, 0]
]
```

**Manual calculation:**
- Tour 0→1→2→3→0: 20 + 30 + 12 + 35 = 97
- Tour 0→1→3→2→0: 20 + 34 + 12 + 42 = 108
- Tour 0→2→1→3→0: 42 + 30 + 34 + 35 = 141

**Optimal cost: 97**

## Variations and Extensions

### 1. Asymmetric TSP (ATSP)
**Mathematical Formulation:**
- $d(i,j) \neq d(j,i)$ for some $i, j \in V$
- Requires directed graph representation
- Same DP approach: $\texttt{dp}[S][i] = \min_{j \in S \setminus \{i\}} \left( \texttt{dp}[S \setminus \{i\}][j] + d(j,i) \right)$

**Complexity:**
- Still $O(n^2 \times 2^n)$ time complexity
- No symmetry optimizations possible
- Must consider all possible starting cities

### 2. Multiple Traveling Salesmen (mTSP)
**Mathematical Formulation:**
- Given $k$ salesmen and $n$ cities
- Find $k$ tours such that each city is visited exactly once
- Minimize $\max_{i=1}^k \texttt{cost}(\texttt{tour}_i)$ or $\sum_{i=1}^k \texttt{cost}(\texttt{tour}_i)$

**Complexity:**
- NP-hard even for $k = 2$
- Requires different approaches (genetic algorithms, etc.)

### 3. TSP with Time Windows (TSPTW)
**Mathematical Formulation:**
- Each city $i$ has time window $[a_i, b_i]$
- Must visit city $i$ between times $a_i$ and $b_i$
- Add time constraints to standard TSP

**Mathematical Constraints:**
- Arrival time at city $i$: $t_i \in [a_i, b_i]$
- Travel time: $t_{i+1} \geq t_i + d(i,i+1)$
- Hard to solve optimally

### 4. Prize-Collecting TSP (PC-TSP)
**Mathematical Formulation:**
- Each city $i$ has prize $p_i$
- Not all cities must be visited
- Maximize: $\sum_{i \in \texttt{tour}} p_i - \texttt{cost}(\texttt{tour})$

**Mathematical Objective:**
$$\max_{S \subseteq V} { \sum_{i \in S} p_i - \texttt{cost}(\texttt{cycle}(S)) }$$
where $\texttt{cycle}(S)$ is the minimum cost tour visiting cities in $S$
