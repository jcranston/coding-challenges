# Find the Duplicate Number

## Problem
Given an array nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is in the range [1, n] inclusive, there is exactly one duplicate number in nums. Your task is to find the duplicate number. You must not modify the array (assume it is read-only), use only constant extra space, and the runtime complexity should be less than O(n^2).

## Clarifications & Constraints
- The input array nums has length n + 1, where n >= 1.
- Each integer in nums is between 1 and n (inclusive).
- There is only one repeated number, but it could be repeated more than once.
- You must not modify the input array (treat it as read-only).
- You must use only constant, O(1), extra space.
- Your algorithm should run in less than O(n^2) time.
