# Explanation: Valid Anagram (LeetCode 242)

## Problem Recap
Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `True` if `t` is an anagram of `s`, and `False` otherwise. Both strings consist of lowercase English letters. The function should be case-sensitive and return a boolean value.

## High-Level Approach
The core idea is to check whether both strings have exactly the same characters with the same frequencies. If so, they are anagrams. The most efficient way is to count the occurrences of each character in both strings and compare the counts.

## Step-by-Step Breakdown
1. **Length Check:**
   - If the lengths of `s` and `t` differ, they cannot be anagrams. Return `False` immediately.
2. **Character Counting:**
   - Use a hash table (dictionary) to count the frequency of each character in `s`.
   - Decrement the count for each character found in `t`.
3. **Final Check:**
   - If all counts are zero, the strings are anagrams. Otherwise, they are not.

## Annotated Canonical Solution
```python
from collections import defaultdict

def valid_anagram(s: str, t: str) -> bool:
    # Early exit if lengths differ
    if len(s) != len(t):
        return False
    char_counter = defaultdict(int)
    # Count characters in s
    for c in s:
        char_counter[c] += 1
    # Subtract counts for characters in t
    for c in t:
        char_counter[c] -= 1
    # If all counts are zero, s and t are anagrams
    return all(count == 0 for count in char_counter.values())
```
- **Why this works:**
  - If `t` is an anagram of `s`, every increment for a character in `s` will be matched by a decrement for the same character in `t`, resulting in all counts being zero.
  - The early length check avoids unnecessary computation for obviously non-anagram pairs.

- **Alternative (pythonic) approach:**
  - `return Counter(s) == Counter(t)`
  - This is concise and leverages Python's standard library, but the explicit approach above is more educational.

## Test Cases & Edge Cases
- `s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"` → `True`
- `s = "rat", t = "car"` → `False`
- Edge: `s = "a", t = "a"` → `True`
- Edge: `s = "a", t = "b"` → `False`
- Edge: `s = "", t = ""` → `True` (if allowed by constraints)

## Common Pitfalls
- Not checking string lengths first (can lead to incorrect results or wasted computation).
- Forgetting to handle case sensitivity (the function is case-sensitive by assumption).
- Not accounting for all characters (e.g., missing a character in one string).

## Variations
- If the strings can contain Unicode or mixed-case characters, use `collections.Counter` for robustness.
- If the input size is very large, consider early exits and memory-efficient counting.

## Invariants
- After processing, the sum of all character counts should be zero if and only if the strings are anagrams.
