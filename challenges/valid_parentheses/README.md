# Valid Parentheses

Given a string `s` containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:
- Open brackets are closed by the same type of brackets.
- Open brackets are closed in the correct order.

## Example

```
Input: s = "()"
Output: true

Input: s = "()[]{}"
Output: true

Input: s = "(]"
Output: false
```

## Constraints
- 1 <= s.length <= 10^4
- `s` consists of parentheses only: '()[]{}'.
